# DT-Third-Party-API-Challenge

This Project is to showcase the functionality of displaying a dynamic work day schedule.

When you launched the website, there are a few things that will be displayed:
<br> 1. Current time will be displayed with the to the very second in your timezone
<br>2. Color coding will be applied to highlight the specified timeslot you will be partaking
<br>a. Maroon (red) = showcases the current hour timeslot
<br>b. light green = showcases the next hour
<br>c. gray = showcases the previous hour

![alt text = "Work Day Scheduler"](Work_Day_Scheduler.JPG)

The next neat thing about its functionality is being able to save text.
<br>
<br>For example, let's say if you wanted to add notes or simply add more information to that designated timeslot.
<br>You would first enter the text in the box to the right of the hour clock

![alt text = "Entering text to the 9am timeslot"](Entering_Info_9AM.JPG)

<br>From there simply click on the save Icon to the right of the text box and presto! It is now saved
<br>Even if you refresh the page now, that information is stored to your local storage to reference at your own convenience.
